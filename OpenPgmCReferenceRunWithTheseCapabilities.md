**`*` Clock selection** is specified by two system environment variables <tt>PGM_TIMER</tt> governing how to get the current time, and <tt>PGM_SLEEP</tt><sup>†</sup> governing how to wait for an interval of time.


### Clock Selection ###
Kernel timer resolution is in a period of change, kernels can be found with standard resolutions of 1-4ms, with high resolution timers providing microsecond to nanosecond resolution.  <tt><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rdtsc'>RDTSC</a></tt> is a very cheap mechanism for applications to get the current time in high resolution, however multiple core systems may suffer from drift between each core, some systems may vary frequency in power saving states.  Particularly prone to error are [Hyperthread](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthread) based processors from Intel, it is highly recommended to disable hyperthreading on all processors wishing to run high speed PGM based messaging.  The High Precision Event Timer, HPET, was created to provide a system wide stable timer in multi-core systems to resolve TSC irregularities.

An operating system calculates the current time of day based off various sources to provide an accurate, stable, and monotonic source to applications.  On Linux the system time is generated from the APIC PM Timer or HPET with interpolation using TSC which can cause the time to become non-monotonic.  Calculating a stable system time is not cheap and historically many applications have been re-engineered to minimise the calls to functions like <tt>gettimeofday()</tt> due to this overhead, using <tt>RDTSC</tt> has been a popular method to bypass this overhead, with multi-core systems either process affinity has to be used to keep using the same TSC source, or reading from the HPET device instead but at a ~500 nanosecond cost.

The RTC device <tt>/dev/rtc</tt> cannot be shared between multiple applications but offers a stable time source external to the TSC and is available on all systems, compared with limited availability of HPET.

On Linux TSC is calibrated using the method defined by <tt>PGM_SLEEP</tt>, and either value can be overridden by defining <tt>RDTSC_FREQUENCY</tt> in kilohertz.  It is recommended to set this frequency or use an alternative timing mechanism on Solaris, and on modern Intel machines with SpeedStep or Turbo technology with variable clock rates.

### Examples ###
Use the PGM protocol via raw sockets using the <tt>CAP_NET_RAW</tt> capability,
```
$ sudo execcap 'cap_net_raw=ep' pgmsend moo
```

On a single core Intel system, use TSC and <tt>usleep</tt>.
```
$ PGM_TIMER=TSC PGM_SLEEP=USLEEP pgmsend moo
```
or,
```
$ pgmsend moo
```

On a multi-core Intel system with HPET device, use HPET and <tt>usleep</tt>.
```
$ sudo chmod a+r /dev/hpet
$ PGM_TIMER=HPET PGM_SLEEP=USLEEP pgmsend moo
```
or,
```
$ sudo chmod a+r /dev/hpet
$ PGM_TIMER=HPET pgmsend moo
```

On a hyper-threaded Intel system without HPET device, use the RTC device and <tt>usleep</tt>.
```
$ PGM_TIMER=RTC PGM_SLEEP=USLEEP pgmsend moo
```
or,
```
$ PGM_TIMER=RTC pgmsend moo
```

On a multi-core system without HPET and for multiple applications, use <tt>gettimeofday</tt> and <tt>usleep</tt>.
```
$ PGM_TIMER=GTOD PGM_SLEEP=USLEEP pgmsend moo

```

On a Solaris system with a 3.2Ghz core, set the TSC frequency first.
```
$ RDTSC_FREQUENCY=3200 PGM_TIMER=TSC PGM_SLEEP=USLEEP pgmsend moo
