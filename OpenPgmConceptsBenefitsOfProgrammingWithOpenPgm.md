Compared with regular TCP/IP sockets there are many advantages that OpenPGM can provide throughout an applications life cycle.

### Benefits During Development ###
  * OpenPGM allows location independence of applications.
  * OpenPGM makes it easy to develop resilient systems because redundant producers and consumers can be added with no transport overhead.
  * OpenPGM is thread-safe, it can be used within multi-threaded programs.


### Benefits During Operation ###
  * OpenPGM programs can publish multicast messages to distribute information quickly and reliably to many consumers.
  * OpenPGM programs are location independent, and port easily between platforms.


### Benefits During Upgrades ###
  * OpenPGM distributed application systems are easier to maintain than traditional networked application systems.
  * OpenPGM distributed application systems scale smoothly as you add new component processes.
  * OpenPGM distributed application systems have longer useful lifetimes than traditional networked application systems.
  * OpenPGM software supports many hardware and software platforms, so programs port smoothly as your environment evolves and expands.
